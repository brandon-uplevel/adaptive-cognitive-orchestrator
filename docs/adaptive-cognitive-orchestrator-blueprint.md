## Agentic Capabilities

### Reasoning and Decision-Making
The ACO, powered by Gemini, can perform complex reasoning to:
- Diagnose problems
- Generate potential solutions
- Prioritize actions
- Utilize tools
- Example: If a user says "My internet is down," the agent can query internal systems, analyze data, suggest solutions like restarting the modem, or log a support ticket

### Goal-Driven Adaptation
- Maintains a "goal state" for each conversation
- Dynamically adapts strategy if the primary path is blocked
- Identifies alternative sub-goals or actions to achieve the main objective
- Ensures resilience beyond predefined flows
- Example: If a user can't restart their modem, the agent can schedule a technician visit instead

### Proactive Information Seeking
- Proactively requests missing information needed to achieve goals
- Clearly asks for required data rather than getting stuck or handing off prematurely
- Example: If the agent needs an account number, it will explicitly request it

### Tool Use
- Dynamically selects and executes external API calls to achieve call objectives
- Uses "connector tools" for CRM and other specific tasks via API calls
- Gemini models are specifically designed with "native tool use" capabilities

### Long-Term Memory and Context
- Accesses past interaction history, customer preferences, and previous issues through Cloud Spanner integration
- Enables personalized conversations
- Avoids repetitive questions and builds rapport
- Example: The agent can greet a returning customer by name and reference their previous interactions

### Learning and Continuous Improvement
- Incorporates robust MLOps pipeline for continuous learning
- Automated quality assurance against performance baselines
- Uses "golden transcripts" and "semantic similarity" for regression testing
- Leverages Google Cloud services like Vertex AI Pipelines, Model Registry, and dedicated evaluation services for Generative AI

### Emotional Intelligence
- Understands and responds to human emotions
- Adapts to conversations in real-time
- Achieved through specialized modules or by leveraging Gemini's capabilities
- Uses SSML to control voice attributes and enhance realism

### Interruption Management
- Handles interruptions gracefully
- Uses techniques like VAD, semantic turn detection, and LLM-based prediction
- Includes dedicated "Interruption Management & Pacing Module"
- Manages turn-taking and ensures natural conversation flow

### Dynamic Re-planning
- Continuously evaluates conversations
- Adjusts strategy based on real-time cues and feedback
- Adapts actions to achieve goals

### Self-Correction
- Identifies and rectifies its own errors or limitations
- "Reasons about its own reasoning"
- Adjusts approach accordingly

### Proactive Behavior
- Anticipates user needs beyond reactive responses
- Initiates actions accordingly
- Proactively offers assistance or suggests relevant information based on user context

## Architecture Updates: FreeSWITCH Integration
